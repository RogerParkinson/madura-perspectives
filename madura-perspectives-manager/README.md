Madura Perspectives Manager
=========================

Perspectives, in this case, are snap-in applications that plug into the main application and share the login information, locale etc of the surrounding application. That means the subapplications don't have to worry about those issues and can be simpler. It also means you can construct a semi-dynamic workspace with plugged in apps that share a common look and feel (another thing that is set globally) and can even 
communicate with each other.
